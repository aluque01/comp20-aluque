The repository is for holding all projects I have done. Git makes it easy to look at code, and also to use as a portfolio in the future. 

My favorite project has to be the transit project. It really challenged my thinking and made me work hard to get all the data sorted and displaying right. It was also the most fun, I was very proud of myself when it finally started working. 

I am most proud of my transit project. it looks nice and clean, and works very well with the data provided. 

I have grown tremendously in terms of my abilities, especially from this class. A lot of the basic concepts from this class transferred over to my other classes and made me understand and appreciate them more. This class really accelerated my knowledge and skill. Without it I would probably be struggling a lot more in 15.

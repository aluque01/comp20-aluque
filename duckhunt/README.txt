So far the only thing implemented has been the canvas get method. The image finally draws after using the onload event. 

So far I'm trying to get the images to place. 

Once I actually figured out how to do this the work seems to og by fairly quick. from 4:30 to around 5:28 so far, did the dirt and a tree. Scaling the tree to look okay was a bit difficult. 

Finished at around 5:51 so it took maybe 45 minutes to an hour of actually working to get this to finish. Took about 4 or 5 hours to figure out the kinks with canvas API, so maybe around 7 hours total max to finish this project. This took longer than expected due to having to learn the canvas API. 

Used the image loading method described in "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial/Using_images". I might switch over to using the <img> tag method as it would probably be more efficient later on. 

As of now all required elements have been drawn.

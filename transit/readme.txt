MBTA Map and Schedule Rodeo

This page uses he java script geolocation object to track your location and show you the nearest subway station. The subway stations come in at random, so only the red, blue, or orange show up at once, or itâ€™s possible for no stations to show. The webpage displays the distance to the closest train station. 

The page will also display all live information for each subway station, including direction, time remaining, and stop. This is displayed when someone clicks on the station in an info window. 

For now everything has been implemented, there are some intermittent issues with displaying text on chrome, but it comes and goes. 

This took aroudn 15 to 20 hours to complete.
